## TypeRacerCheat

A simple chrome extension that hacks a game called TypeRacer. If you're interested in reading my code, then check out src/contentScript.js (the rest is boilerplate).

## Try it out

- Download the packed extension: [TypeRacerCheat.crx](https://github.com/Davidster/TypeRacerCheat/blob/master/bin/TypeRacerCheat.crx?raw=true)
- Drag it into the chrome extensions menu (chrome://extensions/).
- Go to [typeracer](http://play.typeracer.com/) and spam the space bar once you start playing.
